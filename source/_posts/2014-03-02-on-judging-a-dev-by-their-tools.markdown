I have always found that developers who spend time perfecting their tools
turn out to be very passionate with their work. After all, it takes _a lot_ of
time, trial and error, to figure out the work flow that works best for
you.

However that is not to say that devs who do not spend time on their tools are
not passionate - there can be a host of reasons why they haven't focused on
building their tools. It's an asymmetrical indicator.

Consider two devs that both using Vim. One has morphed a boilerplate into
their own unique set of key bindings, while the other is still using the
boilerplate in stock. Obviously the former has shown 'effort' and is likely to
enjoy what they do. However no judgement should be made on the latter, perhaps
the original key bindings were perfect, or they were too busy focusing on more
important things. Who knows.

There are so many asymmetrical indicators that are too easily taken to be
symmetrical. Just a random example from my head: a thick French accent
indicates that someone is likely to be French, but not having one does not
indicate that they are not.
