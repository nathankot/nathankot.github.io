Let's make a tool that helps you increase your social reach, for me I want to
do:

1 Tweet Per Day
1 Blog Post Per Week
1 Pull Request Per Week
1 Reddit Submission Per Week
1 HN Submission Per Week

What if there were a tool that lets you deposit a 'bond' and deducts cash from
your account every time you skip?

OR, a service that stops providing you a service if you forget, and you have
to top up to use it again?
