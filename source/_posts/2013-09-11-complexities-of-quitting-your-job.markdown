It's been two weeks since I started working full time on Ideasaurus, I'm
writing this down so that I can reflect on my current opinions in the future.
It may be a _what the hell was I thinking??_ moment, or perhaps a _I made the
right move!!_ moment.

# I quit my job

I had an awesome job at Grabone. It was actually my first ever full-time job
and I resigned after a short 6 month sprint. That goes against everything most
graduates had ever been taught about their first job (e.g stay on for at least
a year).

I'm not just being nice when I say that it was awesome. One sentence can
really paint an accurate picture of what it was like there: *we have nerf
guns.*

# Complexities of controlling all your time

I was about to start this heading off with 'Complexities of having too much
time', but I would be lying. I _do not have too much time_, there have been a
few days where I actually felt like I have less time. I guess the real
difficulties arise from being responsible for your own time. Things get
magnified 

# Looking forwards
