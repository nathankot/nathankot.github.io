This morning I was in Phuket at the Surf Club attempting to ride the waves. I
did horribly. Amongst our group was a couple of Russian guys and one of them,
who got the hang of it a little more quickly, was shouting to his friend 'No
pain no gain.' A clich√© phrase but nonetheless very relevant to all of us at
the time. Screw it. Rather than trying very hard not to fall, first I gotta
see how far I can get before falling. My surfing skills got incrementally
better after that.

It seems like this type of over-confidence is necessary for learning. Thinking
back, when I was a kid I was way too overconfident that I could run a mmorpg
private server - eventually it got me programming.
