There are so many different places to communicate with the world nowadays. I
find it difficult enough to share things on my blog, let alone on Twitter,
Facebook, Coderwall etc. So from now on I will be doing this:

1. Write stuffs on my blog.
2. Share the link on suitable social media.
3. Don't worry about having to update everything individually.
