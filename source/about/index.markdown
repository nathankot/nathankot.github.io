# Nathan Kot

A young builder, creator, programmer, entrepreneur. I spend most of my time
working on my startup [Ideasaurus][ideasaurus] - a platform for bringing
business idea management and execution into the future.

Born and raised in New Zealand, I see a bright future for our IT industry.

On a more technical note, I have an ongoing love affair with Ruby and VIM.

You can _drop me a line_ at me@nathankot.com,

I'd love to hear from you :)
