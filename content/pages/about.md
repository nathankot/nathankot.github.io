Hello! I've been making software for the greater part of my life, and have had
the fortunate opportunity to be involved with some interesting things.

I am currently on an extended break from 'serious work', with the original
intention of getting away from the computer. However I still find myself
being drawn back into software, so I'm dabbling on:

- Seeing if I can foster discussion outside of walled gardens by improving
  discoverability, approachability.

- After many years of negligence, I finally have more free time and intend to
  improve / work on [Rumuki](https://rumuki.com/), a project I had started
  around 2015.
